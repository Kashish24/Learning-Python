In this script. we need to generate JSON files for different Tables. Some Key-Value pair vaules will be different for different table while other key-value pair remain same for all the tables.

Psedocode for the above program:

1) Read JSON file. It will simply read it as a text.
2) Convert the Above read text to the JSON format using JSON Package.
3) Read the excel sheet in which we will have a detail of values of the keys(Key-Value Pair) which we need to change for different JSON files(i.e. for different Tables).
4) Iterating through different rows of excel sheet:
    Assigning table specific values to the keys.
    Generating one unique name for the output JSON file.
    Opening a .JSON file with above generated name
      Write the content to the output file.
